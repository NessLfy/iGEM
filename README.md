# iGEM
Welcome to the iGEM repositories. In this you will find all of our bio-informatic and modeling scripts: 

- Run_BLAST.ipynb : a pipeline to run the BLAST algorithm from the NCBI server and read/filter the results. We used this pipaline to verify the guide RNA that we develop in order to avoid false positive in our detection

- Target sequence extraction.ipynb : a pipeline to extract DNA sequence from protein name using different protein databases

- Modeling.ipynb : kinetic modeling notebook of our LwCas13a SHERLOCK reaction

- Paper_test_quantification.ipynb : semi-quantitative analysis of the results of our lateral flow assay 

- PyCCELL_PRFQT: the script to analyze plate reader data (and the .py version to import in other scripts)

- SHERLOCK_modeling: Fitting of the experimental results gotten from SHERLOCK experiments using the kinetic model

- SHERLOCK_probe_dilution: Plotting of the results gotten from the SHERLOCK experiments on probe concentration optimization
