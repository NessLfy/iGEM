# iGEM
Welcome to the iGEM repositories. In this you will find all of our bio-informatic and modeling scripts: 

- Run_BLAST.ipynb : a pipeline to run the BLAST algorithm from the NCBI server and read/filter the results. We used this pipaline to verify the guide RNA that we develop in order to avoid false positive in our detection. 
- Target sequence extraction.ipynb : a pipeline to extract DNA sequence from protein name using different protein databases
